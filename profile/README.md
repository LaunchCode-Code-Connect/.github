## Welcome to the Official LaunchCode Alumni Hub! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Welcome! We're excited to have you as a member of this new alumni community.
Information on how to join this group is at the bottom of this README file.

## There is a problem that most of us encounter as alumni: 
**Once we graduate from LaunchCode, there is no longer a defined place for us to gather, collaborate, and continue our learning journey.** 

Because of this, most of us drift away on our own path, losing that human community we had access to during our class.
And in turn, we lose the support of our fellow developers as we fight to gain our first job in tech or to advance in our technology careers.

## It's Time to Change That

This Github Organization will serve as a community for LaunchCode alumni to form relationships with other alumni (whether they just graduated or graduated years ago) and collaborate on pre-defined and organic projects. 

## Content Schedule

Every Monday (starting 12/2/2024), we will publish a weekly update.
This update will include new apprenticeship job postings in LaunchCode Mission Control that apprenticeship candidates can apply to.
It will also include new on LaunchCode volunteer opportunities, and other LaunchCode news. 
It will be a concise update that allows both new and old alumni to stay in the loop.

Every Monday (starting 12/2/2024), we will publish a weekly problem set. 
This set will include Data Structure & Algorithm (DSA) questions that are incredibly common in Software Engineer interviews in the wider industry.
It will also include a set of relevant LeetCode or other questions for Data Science and Data Analysis alumni to sharpen their skills.
These sets will be published in the `weekly-problem-set` repo. 
We recommend creating a fork of this repository under this `Launch-Code-Connect` organization with a name like `[your-name]-weekly-problem-set`.
This will allow us to easily see any of your engagement with this organizations content.

The first Monday of every month (starting 12/2/2024), we will publish a set of project challenges.
These will be pre-defined project proposals with listed requirements for Intermediate and Advanced projects.
You will be able to work on these alone or together to continue to develop your technical skills.
These project ideas will be published in the `monthly-project-challenges` repo.
For the project/s you wish to take on, we recommend creating a new repo in the `Launch-Code-Connect` organization with a name like `[your-name]-[your-name-for-project]`.

Every month (first monday of month), the coolest pre-defined or organic project created by a group member or members will be pinned to the home page and shared with the wider LaunchCode organization.

## Organic Content

Besides these pre-defined projects, you will be allowed to create your own repositories to collaborate on any projects you wish inside this new group.

We have also enabled the "Discussions" feature for this organization.
Please use it to share your wins, look for project partners, and/or connect with other alumni.

## Things we want to emphasize:
*  While engaging with this group, you will be expected to be professional and follow LaunchCode's rules of conduct.
*  This group will not be actively staffed. It is not a space to seek instructional help from LaunchCode staff. It is to give our alumni some light guidance on ways to continue to develop their skills and create a community for alumni to connect as they take on pre-defined challenges or organic group projects.
* You can only join this group if you have graduated from a LaunchCode course


## Message specifically for alumni currently in LaunchCode's candidate pool

**The more you engage with the new group's weekly problem sets and project challenges, the better you'll become as a Software Developer and/or Data Analyst/Engineer.** 

**The more you engage with the group, thereby increasing your skills and showing your effort over time, the more Apprenticeship and/or Direct-Hire interview opportunities we'll be able to connect you with.**

I know that when I was a student (August 2018 - February 2019) and then an Instructional Assistant at LaunchCode (2020-2024), I didn't realize how successful LaunchCode was at actually placing people. 

From the inside now, I see we have been waaaay more successful than I thought in the past.

**You absolutely have a chance to break into the industry with LaunchCode and engaging with this group will increase your likelihood of success.**

Excited to have you here and looking forward to seeing your work in the group!


## Disclaimer about ChatGPT, Github Painting:
ChatGPT is a super valuable tool we're starting to teach students about in current and future curriculum. BUT, it depends on how you use it. 
You should use ChatGPT to help you understand pieces of code you find, answer troubleshooting questions, and help with idea generation. If you have ChatGPT generate some code that you then take the time to understand and customize to your app's needs, that's fine!

But, having ChatGPT generate a bunch of code you don't understand that you then paste into your projects and commit to this group won't help you.  

You'll need to be able to do this kind of work to get into, and ESPECIALLY, to stay and protect your spot in this industry (as we've seen with the super fun market conditions between 2022 and now). 

From personal experience and the experience of friends in the industry that conduct interviews, it is VERY easy to tell when someone didn't write their own code. So please, use any ChatGPT like tools responsibly.

Also, please do not use Paint Github or anything like that: https://paintgithub.com/.
We don't care about you making 20 commits a day, we care about your actual progression as a software developer/data analyst. 

If you were already in the industry and wanted to use one of these tools in case you were applying to specific companies with dumb git activity requirements, then sure.

But, you're not in that position. Please keep your Github activity fully genuine. The pattern of these painting tools is very easy to identify. And if I see it on anyone's profile, it makes it hard to evaluate what pieces of your Github activity are actually genuine. If I can't tell, then I can't recommend you for Apprenticeship interview opportunities.
