# Welcome to the LaunchCode Candidate Technical Resources Page!

## August 2025 Update:
For Q3 2025, there will be no project challenges uploaded. 

Instead, please focus on either the software dev problem set or the data analysis/engineer problem set, depending on your career track. We have seen these types of coding challenges come up a lot more often in software development and data analysis/engineering interviews the last few months.

Have you recently completed a course or earned a technical certification?

### Comprehensive Software Engineer and Data Analysis/Data Engineering Problem Sets

Curated problem sets to become an excellent Software Engineer or Data Analyst/Engineer.

The Software Development problem set will give you the tools to more efficiently load, process, store, and manipulate data in any program, in any language you write code in.

The Data Analysis/Engineer problem set will give you the tools to more efficiently work with large datasets and come up with code to automate your analysis.

Understanding the techniques used to solve these problems will make you a very competitive candidate for Software Engineering and Data Analyst/Engineering roles in the wider job market.


#### 2025 problem sets:
- 2025-software-dev-problem-set
- 2025-data-analysis-problem-set

**To track your work, please create a new repo for the problem set under your Github profile, and copy the README.md file for the problem set over to your new repo**. Then, as you complete the problems in the list on LeetCode, save your answers as individual code files in this repo.



## Responsible Use of Tools

### ChatGPT

AI tools like ChatGPT are fantastic for learning and troubleshooting. Use them responsibly by:

- Understanding and adapting the code they generate to fit your project needs.
- Avoiding “copy-paste” coding practices—you’ll need to fully understand your work to succeed in tech interviews and beyond.
    

### GitHub Activity

Your GitHub activity should reflect genuine progress, not artificially inflated stats from tools like [Paint GitHub](https://paintgithub.com/). Authenticity is crucial when showcasing your skills to potential employers.
