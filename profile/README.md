## Welcome to the Official LaunchCode Alumni Hub! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Welcome! We're excited to have you as a member of this new alumni community.

There is a problem that most of us encounter as alumni: 
**Once we graduate from LaunchCode, there is no longer a defined place for us to gather, collaborate, and continue our learning journey.** 

Because of this, most of us drift away on our own path, losing that human community we had access to during our class.
And in turn, we lose the support of our fellow developers as we fight to gain our first job in tech or to advance in our technology careers.

## It's Time to Change That

This Github Organization will serve as a community for LaunchCode alumni to form relationships with other alumni (whether they just graduated or graduated years ago) and collaborate on pre-defined and organic projects. 

Every Monday (starting 12/2/2024), we will publish a weekly update.
This update will include new job postings in LaunchCode Mission Control that apprenticeship candidates can apply to.
It will also include new on LaunchCode volunteer opportunities, and other LaunchCode news. 
It will be a concise update that allows both new and old alumni to stay in the loop.

Every Monday (starting 12/2/2024), we will publish a weekly problem set. 
This set will include Data Structure & Algorithm (DSA) questions that are incredibly common in Software Engineer interviews in the wider industry.
It will also include a set of relevant LeetCode or other questions for Data Science and Data Analysis alumni to sharpen their skills.
These sets will be published in the `weekly-problem-set` repo. 
We recommend creating a fork of this repository under this `Launch-Code-Connect` organization with a name like `[your-name]-weekly-problem-set`.
This will allow us to easily see any of your engagement with this organizations content.

The first Monday of every month (starting 12/2/2024), we will publish a set of project challenges.
These will be pre-defined project proposals with listed requirements for Intermediate and Advanced projects.
You will be able to work on these alone or together to continue to develop your technical skills.
These project ideas will be published in the `monthly-project-challenges` repo.
For the project/s you wish to take on, we recommend creating a new repo in the `Launch-Code-Connect` organization with a name like `[your-name]-[your-name-for-project]`.

Every month (first monday of month), the coolest pre-defined or organic project created by a group member will be pinned to the home page and shared with the wider LaunchCode organization.

Besides these pre-defined projects, you will be allowed to create your own repositories to collaborate on any projects you wish inside this new group.

We have also enabled the "Discussions" feature for this organization.
Please use it to share your wins, look for project partners, and/or connect with other alumni.

## Things we want to emphasize:
*  While engaging with this group, you will be expected to be professional and follow LaunchCode's rules of conduct. They can be found here: `placeholder`
*  This group will not be actively staffed. It is not a space to seek instructional help from LaunchCode staff. It is to give our alumni some light guidance on ways to continue to develop their skills and create a community for alumni to connect as they take on pre-defined challenges or organic group projects.
* You can only join this group if you have graduated from a LaunchCode course
