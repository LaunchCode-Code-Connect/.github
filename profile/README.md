## Reconnecting the LaunchCode Family

As alumni, we all face a common challenge: after graduation, there are fewer opportunities for us to gather, share knowledge, and continue learning together. Many of us end up navigating our careers alone, losing the incredible community of peers who supported us during our LaunchCode journey.

Let’s change that.

This GitHub Organization is your new home to connect with fellow alumni—whether they graduated last month or years ago. It’s a place to collaborate on meaningful projects, exchange ideas, and continue leveling up as tech professionals.

## 2025 Content Schedule

### Quarterly Project Challenges
Each quarter (January-March, April-June, etc.) we will publish a Software Development, Data Analysis, and Salesforce project challenge. 
The basic requirements of each of these projects will be at the beginner level. But, there will be optional features or additional analysis to implement that will make the project more challenging. 

These challenges will be a perfect way to improve your skills and build a body of work you can show to employers during interviews.

**To participate in the project challenges, please fork the repo of any project you want to build to your personal github profile and make the forked repo public**.
This will allow us to see your work and engagement with the quarterly challenges.

At the end of each quarter, we will showcase our favorite forked project repos.

### Comprehensive Software Engineer and Data Analysis/Data Engineering Problem Sets

Curated problem sets to become an excellent Software Engineer or Data Analyst/Engineer.

The Software Development problem set will give you the tools to more efficiently load, process, store, and manipulate data in any program, in any language you write code in.

The Data Analysis/Engineer problem set will give you the tools to more efficiently work with large datasets and come up with code to automate your analysis.

Understanding the techniques used to solve these problems will make you a very competitive candidate for Software Engineering and Data Analyst/Engineering roles in the wider job market.


#### 2025 problem sets:
- 2025-software-dev-problem-set
- 2025-data-analysis-problem-set

**Please fork the repo of the problem set you want to work through to your personal github profile and make the forked repo public**.
This will allow us to see your work and progress in the problem set.

## Responsible Use of Tools

### ChatGPT

AI tools like ChatGPT are fantastic for learning and troubleshooting. Use them responsibly by:

- Understanding and adapting the code they generate to fit your project needs.
- Avoiding “copy-paste” coding practices—you’ll need to fully understand your work to succeed in tech interviews and beyond.
    

### GitHub Activity

Your GitHub activity should reflect genuine progress, not artificially inflated stats from tools like [Paint GitHub](https://paintgithub.com/). Authenticity is crucial when showcasing your skills to potential employers.
