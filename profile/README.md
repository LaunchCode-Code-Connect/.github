# Welcome to the LaunchCode Alumni Community!

We’re thrilled to have you join this new alumni group! This community is designed to keep the LaunchCode spirit alive and help alumni stay connected, collaborate, and grow. Detailed instructions on how to join this group are available at the bottom of this README file.

## Reconnecting the LaunchCode Family

As alumni, we all face a common challenge: after graduation, there are fewer opportunities for us to gather, share knowledge, and continue learning together. Many of us end up navigating our careers alone, losing the incredible community of peers who supported us during our LaunchCode journey.

Let’s change that.

This GitHub Organization is your new home to connect with fellow alumni—whether they graduated last month or years ago. It’s a place to collaborate on meaningful projects, exchange ideas, and continue leveling up as tech professionals.

## What to Expect

### Weekly Problem Sets

Every Monday, sharpen your skills with Data Structure & Algorithm (DSA) challenges common in software engineering interviews, as well as curated questions for data science and data analysis alumni. You’ll find these in the weekly-problem-set repo.

We recommend creating a fork of the repo (e.g., [your-name]-weekly-problem-set) to showcase your progress and engagement.

### Monthly Project Challenges

On the first Monday of each month, explore Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced project challenges with clearly defined requirements. These challenges are perfect for solo or group work to continue honing your technical skills.

Create a new repo within the Launch-Code-Connect organization for your chosen project (e.g., [your-name]-[project-name]). Exceptional projects will be showcased on the organization’s home page and shared with the broader LaunchCode network!

### Organic Content

In addition to structured projects, you’re encouraged to create your own repositories and collaborate on passion projects. Use the Discussions feature to share achievements, find project partners, and connect with fellow alumni.

### LaunchCode Announcements

We'll publish information about volunteer opportunities and other relevant news in the "Announcements" discussion channel.

## Responsible Use of Tools

### ChatGPT

AI tools like ChatGPT are fantastic for learning and troubleshooting. Use them responsibly by:

- Understanding and adapting the code they generate to fit your project needs.
- Avoiding “copy-paste” coding practices—you’ll need to fully understand your work to succeed in tech interviews and beyond.
    

### GitHub Activity

Your GitHub activity should reflect genuine progress, not artificially inflated stats from tools like [Paint GitHub](https://paintgithub.com/). Authenticity is crucial when showcasing your skills to potential employers.
